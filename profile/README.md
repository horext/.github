## Hi there 👋

Welcome to the Horext project repository! We're excited to have you here.

### 🙋‍♀️ Introduction
Horext is a web application designed to help students at the Universidad Nacional de Ingeniería (UNI) automatically generate their class schedules. Our goal is to make schedule planning simple and efficient, allowing students to focus more on their studies and less on administrative tasks.

### 🧙 Invitation to Join
We are actively seeking new members to join our team! If you're passionate about making a difference in the student community and have skills in web development, project management, or user experience design, we’d love to hear from you.
